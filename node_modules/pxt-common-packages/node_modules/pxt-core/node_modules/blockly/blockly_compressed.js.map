Initialy it affected only BlockMove events but others were\n * added over time.\n *\n * Code was added to reorder BlockChange events added in commit\n * 5578458, for uncertain reasons but most probably as part of an\n * only-partially-successful attemp to fix problems with event\n * ordering during block mutations.  This code should probably have\n * been added to the top of the function, before merging and\n * null-removal, but was added at the bottom for now-forgotten\n * reasons.  See these bug investigations for a fuller discussion of\n * the underlying issue and some of the failures that arose because of\n * this incomplete/incorrect fix:\n *\n * https://github.com/google/blockly/issues/8225#issuecomment-2195751783\n * https://github.com/google/blockly/issues/2037#issuecomment-2209696351\n *\n * Later, in PR #1205 the original O(n^2) implementation was replaced\n * by a linear-time implementation, though additonal fixes were made\n * subsequently.\n *\n * In August 2024 a number of significant simplifications were made:\n *\n * This function was previously called from Workspace.prototype.undo,\n * but the mutation of events by this function was the cause of issue\n * #7026 (note that events would combine differently in reverse order\n * vs. forward order).  The originally-chosen fix for this was the\n * addition (in PR #7069) of code to fireNow to post-filter the\n * .undoStack_ and .redoStack_ of any workspace that had just been\n * involved in dispatching events; this apparently resolved the issue\n * but added considerable additional complexity and made it difficult\n * to reason about how events are processed for undo/redo, so both the\n * call from undo and the post-processing code was removed, and\n * forward=true was made the default while calling the function with\n * forward=false was deprecated.\n *\n * At the same time, the buggy code to reorder BlockChange events was\n * replaced by a less-buggy version of the same functionality in a new\n * function, enqueueEvent, called from fireInternal, thus assuring\n * that events will be in the correct order at the time filter is\n * called.\n *\n * Additionally, the event merging code was modified so that only\n * immediately adjacent events would be merged.  This simplified the\n * implementation while ensuring that the merging of events cannot\n * cause them to be reordered.\n *\n * @param queue Array of events.\n * @param forward True if forward (redo), false if backward (undo).\n *     This parameter is deprecated: true is now the default and\n *     calling filter with it set to false will in future not be\n *     supported.\n * @returns Array of filtered events.\n */\nexport function filter(queue: Abstract[], forward = true): Abstract[] {\n  if (!forward) {\n    deprecation.warn('filter(queue, /*forward=*/false)', 'v11.2', 'v12');\n    // Undo was merged in reverse order.\n    queue = queue.slice().reverse(); // Copy before reversing in place.\n  }\n  const mergedQueue: Abstract[] = [];\n  // Merge duplicates.\n  for (const event of queue) {\n    const lastEvent = mergedQueue[mergedQueue.length - 1];\n    if (event.isNull()) continue;\n    if (\n      !lastEvent ||\n      lastEvent.workspaceId !== event.workspaceId ||\n      lastEvent.group !== event.group\n    ) {\n      mergedQueue.push(event);\n      continue;\n    }\n    if (\n      isBlockMove(event) &&\n      isBlockMove(lastEvent) &&\n      event.blockId === lastEvent.blockId\n    ) {\n      // Merge move events.\n      lastEvent.newParentId = event.newParentId;\n      lastEvent.newInputName = event.newInputName;\n      lastEvent.newCoordinate = event.newCoordinate;\n      // Concatenate reasons without duplicates.\n      if (lastEvent.reason || event.reason) {\n        lastEvent.reason = Array.from(\n          new Set((lastEvent.reason ??
